Note: This is not a mission. These are the basic things I do daily. I’m tracking myself and looking forward to productive inputs.

Start Date: 10-05-2025 (First Day of Mission Streak)

📅 Date: 10-05-2025
This is a brief introduction about how my day went — from morning to night. It’s the beginning of my self-tracking journey.

📅 Date: 11-05-2025 (Second Day of Mission Streak)
No additional notes added.

📅 Date: 15-05-2025
I revised Java language concepts, practiced aptitude (Time and Work), did some speaking practice, and revised Web Development concepts.

📅 Date: 26-05-2025
Between 20th to 26th May, I focused on learning Java and working on aptitude regularly.

📅 Date: 27-05-2025 to 03-06-2025
I started a new challenge focusing on DSA, Aptitude, and a JavaScript project.
There’s no academic load this week, so I have enough time to focus on myself — both soft skills and hard skills.

📅 Date: 03-06-2025 to 13-06-2025
I completed a full frontend development course and built some basic-level projects.
This marks the beginning of a new challenge with some strict rules.
From now on, I’ll push myself with maximum effort.
Every decision I make will be evaluated based on whether it will bring pride or regret.

📅 Date: 14-06-2025
Today, I did something new for myself — it might be normal for others, but I created a local server (localhost) and printed some custom/funny text.

I’ve officially entered Monk Mode — full focus, no distractions.
This is Day One of my #90DaysHardChallenge.
I’m proud of the effort I made today.

📅 Date: 15-06-2025
Today, I successfully installed MongoDB and learned some basic commands for performing CRUD operations using mongod.

This is Day 2 of the challenge. I’m not very happy with my productivity today.
Although I worked, it wasn’t enough to push my limits or create pressure.
I did use Postman and learned about the POST method, but I didn’t solve any DSA or Aptitude problems.
Overall, it wasn’t extraordinary — but I still learned something valuable.

📅 Date: 17-06-2025
Today, I resolved the Node.js and MongoDB connection setup.
I also revised key SQL concepts.
My productivity was around 50% — the rest of the day was lost to laziness.
I’m aiming to bring out a better version of myself tomorrow.

📅 Date: 18-06-2025
I worked on Node.js today and solved a few simple interest-based aptitude questions.
I was able to solve them correctly.
However, I only gave about 40% of my effort today — I could have done more.

📅 Date: 19-06-2025
I spent around 60% of the day solving aptitude questions based on Time and Work.
Then, I spent about 1–2 hours completing CRUD operations in Node.js using MongoDB and Mongoose.
I also worked on routing and practiced some exercise.
Overall, I’d say the day was 80% productive.
There was a little distraction, but that’s okay — it happens.

📅 Date: 20-06-2025 (Morning Session)
Today’s productivity started at 6 AM and lasted until around 12 PM.
I worked on Aptitude (Speed, Distance, and Time), practiced string functions, and took one aptitude test.
I was about 50% satisfied with today’s output.
Although it was a slow pace, I was still in the flow, and I’m happy I showed up.

📅 Date: 21-06-2025 (Later Session)
I solved 10 questions based on the “Average” topic and did a little exercise.
Overall, I’d rate my productivity at 10% today — I’m not satisfied with the output.

📅 Date: 25-06-2025 (Morning Session)
I solved LCM and HCF based questions , Research about DSA  important Patterns which will be help a lot to learn faster
